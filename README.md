# MEV
Dynamic Models of the Multiple Emergency Ventilator, a 10+ bed low-cost medical ventilation system.

These models were developed using the Modelica language to support the development of the MEV system, see the [MEV website](https://mev.deib.polimi.it) for further details. The models were run successfully with the open source tool [OpenModelica](https://openmodelica.org) v. 1.16.0 and 1.17.0  and with the commercial tool [Dymola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymola) v. 2020X and v. 2021, producing the same results.

The library is released as open source under BSD 3-clause.

If you want to run the models yourself, we suggest you to download and install the OpenModelica suite, then put the MEV directory on your local file system and open the package.mo file with OMEdit. You can then explore the model library and run all the individual component tests, as well as the simulation scenarios described in the MEV technical reports.
